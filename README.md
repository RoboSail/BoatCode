# BoatCode

BoatCode is a very thin Arduino library that serves as a container for starter boat code sketches for RoboSail.  Some examples use more sensors than others.

> As of this writing, the "library" portion of the library (the header file) is empty.  This is by design, taking advantage of [the format of an Arduino Library](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-IDE-1.5:-Library-specification) to easily bundle examples and present them to the Arduino IDE (in the dropdown menu of examples).


Installation
------------

This repository is an Arduino Library, and should be downloaded to your Arduino Libray folder -- the Libraries folder in the Sketchbook location.
